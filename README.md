# How to add crosshair lines in .NET-MAUI SfCartesianChart
This repository demonstrates how to add crosshair lines to a .NET MAUI Cartesian Chart, making it easier for users to analyze data. The crosshair lines are dynamically updated based on user touch interaction with the chart. Two methods are provided for implementing this feature: using GraphicsView with ChartInteractiveBehavior and using Annotations with ChartInteractiveBehavior.
## Methods to Add Crosshair Lines
### 1. Using GraphicsView with ChartInteractiveBehavior
In this approach, we use a combination of GraphicsView and ChartInteractiveBehavior to render the crosshair lines based on the user's touch position.
### 2. Using Annotations with ChartInteractiveBehavior
In this method, Annotations are used alongside ChartInteractiveBehavior to dynamically position the crosshair lines on the chart, updating them as the user interacts.
## Output
Both methods dynamically render crosshair lines that follow the user's touch, improving the chart's interactivity and making it easier to analyze data points on the chart.

## Troubleshooting
If you are facing a path too long exception when building this example project, close Visual Studio and rename the repository to short and build the project.
